## Quick Start

This quick start will guide you through the basic steps to get up and running with the Phrase Client.

#### 1. Install

[Download and install](https://phrase.com/cli) the client for your platform. See our [detailed installation guide](https://help.phrase.com/help/installation-1) for more information.

##### Homebrew

If you use homebrew, we have provided a tap to make installation easier on Mac OS X:

        brew tap phrase/brewed
        brew install phrase

The tap is linked to our Formula collection and will be updated, when you call `brew update` as well.

#### 2. Init

Initialize your project by executing the `init` command. This lets you define your preferred locale file format, source files and more.

    $ cd /path/to/project
    $ phrase init

#### 3. Upload your locale files

Use the `push` command to upload your locale files from your defined [sources](https://help.phrase.com/help/configuration):

    $ phrase push

#### 4. Download your locale files

Use the `pull` command to download the most recent locale files back into your project according to your [targets](https://help.phrase.com/help/configuration):

    $ phrase pull

#### 5. Docker

You can also use `phrase` through a docker image, without installing the cli on your computer.

    $ docker run --rm phrase/phrase-cli:2.0.15 help

Some commands are interactive and require the `-it` flag.

    $ docker run -it phrase/phrase-cli:2.0.15 init

You can also use the docker image as base for more complex images.

#### 6. More

To see a list of all available commands, simply execute:

    $ phrase

To see all supported options for a command, simple use the `--help` flag:

    $ phrase locales list --help

See our [detailed guides](https://help.phrase.com/help/phrase-in-your-terminal) for in-depth instructions on how to use the Phrase Client.
