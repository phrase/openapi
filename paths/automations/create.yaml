              List of project IDs to associate with the automation.

            items:
              type: string

            description: |
              Translation states used when selecting keys for a job. 
              States are derived from associated translations, not the keys themselves. 
              When review workflow is enabled, `ready_for_review` is internally treated as `translated`.

              enum: [unverified, untranslated, ready_for_review]
