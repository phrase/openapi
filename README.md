# OpenAPI specification for Phrase

## Commands

* `npm install` installs the dependencies
* `npm start` builds API clients
* `npm run lint` lints your changes

## Contribution

This project relies on [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) used by [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) to generate proper changelogs and increment versions of the generated client libraries affected by the PR. Please use [appropriate prefixes](https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/Conventional_Commits.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index) when giving titles to your PRs as they decide whether there will be a version bump and changelog entry.

These changelogs and version bumps are generated as a separate pull requests (one for each client library) and currently need to be merged manually.

### PR titles

PR titles are important, as they are used to generate changelogs and version bumps for the generated client libraries. The format is `change_type(affected_library): description #STRINGS-TICKET`.

The `change_type` is one of the following:
* `feat`: A new feature. Also applies to extending the schema with new endpoints, properties, query parameters. For every schema change, a new version of every client library needs to be generated.
* `fix`: A bug fix. Also applies to fixing the schema (e.g. fixing a typo in a property name).
* `docs`: Documentation only changes. This includes changes to the OpenAPI spec (e.g. field descriptions), but not to the schema itself. This does not require a new version of the client libraries.
* `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example: a change in github actions).

`affected_library` could be for example `PHP`, `Java`, `Go`, `Python`, `Ruby`, `CLI`, or `JS`, but most commonly it's `API`, in case of any schema changes.

### Example

You added an endpoint in Phrase Strings. In this project you do the following:

1. Add newly added schema (if any) to `/schemas/` directory
2. Add new endpoints to `/paths/` directory and reference it in `paths.yaml`
3. `npm start` to re-build the clients
4. Open a PR with an informative title (e.g. `feat(API): Add an API endpoint for cat pics`)
5. Merge automated documentation PR [(details)](#documentation-sync)

## Workflow

The following repositories are generated upon pushing to this one:

https://github.com/phrase/phrase-go

https://github.com/phrase/phrase-java

https://github.com/phrase/phrase-js

https://github.com/phrase/phrase-php

https://github.com/phrase/phrase-python

https://github.com/phrase/phrase-ruby

https://github.com/phrase/phrase-cli

### Deployment diagram

## Documentation Sync

Changes pushed to the main branch automatically trigger an internal workflow that updates the API documentation based on the latest OpenAPI schema.

This includes:

1. Pulling the most recent schema from this repository,
2. Regenerating the documentation site,
3. Deploying the updated docs.

You don't need to take any additional steps. Just make sure your changes are properly committed and merged into main â€“ the documentation will be updated automatically.

This setup ensures that the public API documentation always reflects the current OpenAPI spec.

## Specification

### Defining parameters

`POST`/`PUT` requests should define parameters within `requestBody` section, like the following:

```yaml
requestBody:
  required: true
  content:
    application/json:
      schema:
        type: object
        title: key/create/parameters
        properties:
          branch:
            description: specify the branch to use
            type: string
            example: my-feature-branch
          name:
            description: Key name
            type: string
            example: home.index.headline
```

`parameters` section should contain only those parameters which are part of the URL (typically `project_id` and/or `account_id`)
